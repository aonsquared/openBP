Open Brilliant Pebbles firmware

We are releasing an open version of the Brilliant Pebbles firmware and some documentation on the hardware to help you turn it into your very own device! With a barometer, piezo speaker, a battery and charging circuit you can turn it into a paragliding vario, a weather sensor, a generic timer, or whatever you want!

Please note â€“ uploading another firmware to your Brilliant Pebble will stop it working with the Android and computer apps. We have a section at the bottom of this page that shows how to restore original functionality to your device, but do this at your own risk! We cannot accept any responsibility for any consequences of tinkering with your audible. We recommend doing this for advanced users only.
